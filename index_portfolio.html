                    Misleading information in the 2017 Chilean presidential elections: </h3>

                <p>In a presidential debate, the 2 times president of Chile, Sebastián Piñera, 
                    presented a graph with which he sought to demonstrate that the victimization figures had decreased during his past government.
                    However, the graph left some doubts.
                    The first is the apparent disproportion of the figures. According to the bars on the poster, 22.8 (in blue) looks like one third of 30.7.
                     In reality, one third of 30.7 is 10.2.

                     The second is an omition that affects the interpretation una omisión, que afectaría a la interpretación del gráfico. Piñera compara la cifra de 2013 con las de 2010 y de 2016, (30,7% y 27,3% respectivamente). Pero no aparecen los datos de victimización de 2011, registrada en el segundo año de su gobierno. La ENUSC original en 2011 reveló que se alcanzó el 31,1%.
